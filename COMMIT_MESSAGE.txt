refactor: reorganize codebase for better student learning experience

This commit reorganizes the entire codebase to make it more accessible and
educational for students. All components are now organized by topic with
self-explanatory names, comprehensive demonstrations, and detailed comments.

Major Changes:
- Created organized folder structure by topics (01-basics through 09-advanced)
- Renamed all components with descriptive, self-explanatory names
- Added comprehensive demonstrations with detailed comments and explanations
- Created DemoNavigation page as central hub for all learning materials
- Standardized design patterns using Tailwind CSS consistently
- Updated App.jsx with clean routing structure for all demos
- Enhanced main.jsx with better documentation comments
- Fixed routing inconsistencies (Login/Signup links)
- Created DEMOS_README.md with complete learning guide

New Structure:
- 01-basics: JSX, Props, List Rendering
- 02-state-management: useState examples
- 03-forms: Form handling patterns
- 04-hooks: useEffect, useRef, useMemo, useReducer
- 05-api-integration: Fetch API, Axios, React Query
- 06-routing: Complete applications (Todo App)
- 07-authentication: Supabase integration
- 08-custom-hooks: Custom hook examples
- 09-advanced: Advanced React patterns

Each demo includes:
- JSDoc headers explaining concepts
- Inline comments for key learning points
- Visual examples with explanations
- "Key Concepts" summary sections

This reorganization makes it significantly easier for students to:
- Navigate and find relevant topics
- Understand React concepts through well-documented examples
- Follow a structured learning path
- Access all demonstrations from a central navigation page
